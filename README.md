### üéì **what is:** 42Lausanne
* 42Lausanne is a school that teaches you to code without a teacher.

  >**How ?!! would you tell me.** It's a secret but with the advent of the internet, information is closer than you think, two clicks and you can    find the information that suits you best. That's 42Lausanne, a school that teaches you to search.

  >But not only that, 42Lausannne is a real hive without queen, all the students bring their stone to the building, the notion of teamwork has never been as present as in this school. Find yourself a group of friends and go on an adventure in the multitude of projects that the school offers.

### üèÉ **What i like to do:** 
* I like to do sports, I find it liberates the mind. As for computer science, it allows us to create interactions with others, to surpass ourselves, to find new challenges.
