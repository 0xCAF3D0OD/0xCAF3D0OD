## Hi there i'm Kevin 👋

<!--
**0xCAF3D0OD/0xCAF3D0OD** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on little project for the 42 school in Lausanne
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was very bad at math

* 👤&nbsp;&nbsp;I like programming, i want to learn more but not alone that'a why i want to share with you my new find with this github.

### 🎓 **what is:** 42Lausanne
* 🏫&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 42Lausanne is an informatic school that teaches you to code without teacher.

  >**How ?!! would you tell me.** It's a secret but with the advent of the internet, information is closer than you think, two clicks and you can find the information that suits you best. That's 42Lausanne, a school that teaches you to search.
  >
  >But not only that, 42Lausannne is a real hive without queen, all the students bring their stone to the building, the notion of teamwork has never been as present as in this school. Find yourself a group of friends and go on an adventure in the multitude of projects that the school offers.

### 🏃 **What i like to do:** 
* I like to do sports, I find it liberates the mind. As for computer science, it allows us to create interactions with others, to surpass ourselves, to find new challenges.
