### Hi there 👋

<!--
**0xCAF3D0OD/0xCAF3D0OD** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on little project for the 42 school in Lausanne
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was very bad at math

🙋 **Who am i:** Hi i'm Kevin Di Nocera, i learn different programming langage in 42Lausanne a programming school. I like programming, i want to learn but not alone that'a why i want to share with you my new find with this github.

🎓 **what is:** 42Lausanne is a school that teaches you to code without a teacher. 
  >**How would you tell me?!** It's not a secret anymore but with the advent of the internet, information is closer than you think, two clicks and you can find the information that suits you best. That's 42Lausanne, a school that teaches you to search.
  >
 >But not only that, 42Lausannne is a real hive without queen, all the students bring their stone to the building, the notion of teamwork has never been as present as in this school. Find yourself a group of friends and go on an adventure in the multitude of projects that the school offers.

🏃 **What i like to do:** I like to do sports, I find it liberates the mind. As for computer science, it allows us to create interactions with others, to surpass ourselves, to find new challenges.
