### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**0xCAF3D0OD/0xCAF3D0OD** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on little project for the 42 school in Lausanne
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C and C++
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was very bad at math

ðŸ™‹ Who am i: Hi i'm Kevin Di Nocera, i learn different programming langage in 42Lausanne a programming school. I like programming, i want to learn but not alone that'a why i want to share with you my new find with this github.

ðŸŽ“ what is: 42Lausanne is a school that teaches you to code without a teacher. How would you tell me?! It's not a secret anymore but with the advent of the internet, information is closer than you think, two clicks and you can find the information that suits you best. 
That's 42Lausanne, a school that teaches you to search. But not only that, 42Lausannne is a real hive without queen, all the students bring their stone to the building, the notion of teamwork has never been as present as in this school. Find yourself a group of friends and go on an adventure in the multitude of projects that the school offers.
